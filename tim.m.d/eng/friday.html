        <h1>Friday</h1>
        <p>Friday is the most inspiring day of the week because the weekend is ahead. In addition to work on Fridays, there is a lecture on Internet Search Technologies. This subject is particularly useful for those working with websites, however, my work is not related to web technology and internet search. But I was also interested in this topic - because I use google every day. IT professionals need to know what they are working on and how it is connected. </p>
        <p>During the lectures, I learned the concept of SEO - the process of increasing the quality and quantity of website traffic by increasing the visibility of a website or web page to web search engine users. I learned how Google works - not all search algorithms because they keep it secret, but a basic part.</p>
        <p>One of the prerequisites for passing the course is the five tasks that the group must complete. The group I was working with proved to be strong and it was easy to get things done together because nobody was lazy and everyone worked on an equal footing.</p>
        <p>Another special part of this course is the way the lecturers lead the lectures - all 16 lectures took place, in about 2 months - there were 2 or even 3 lectures in a few days. This allowed me to quickly learn everything and get rid of the course except for the upcoming exam in this subject. The course passed very quickly and at the same time allowed me to learn a lot.</p>
