        <h1>Tuesday</h1>
        <p>Tuesday - It also begins with getting up early from bed, morning routine and going to work. After 2 hours of work I go to university. On Tuesdays I only have one course - mathematical logic - one of the hardest subjects this semester.</p>
<p>Nowadays, logic and a broad and branched branch of science studying the regularities that follow, organized and sound thinking. Logic is the most common way of thinking that people and computers use. While other interests are centered on ideas, such as concepts, statements, judgments, conclusions, laws play a key role. The laws of logic are endless. </p>
<p>Successful completion of this subject requires two test papers, but in practice it proved much more difficult. Hopefully, I will pass this course :D</p>
<p>In my first year of study, there was a similar subject - Discrete Mathematics, the knowledge we were given at the time, is now very helpful. This knowledge, or rather its base, also makes it easier for me to understand some algorithms at work. Both of these courses taught me to do operations on sets, with binary failures, gave me the knowledge to prove mathematical induction, and other knowledge needed by programmers.</p>
<p>After returning to work and home.</p>
