        <h1>Monday</h1>
        <p>Monday - this is the most difficult day of the week, because after the weekend it is difficult to gather your thoughts and start working again. The same thing happens to me - I have to get up at 6:00 am to not miss work.</p>
        <p>In my case, a student's life is mostly work, and only after that lectures. However, that does not mean that I do not attend lectures at all! I don't have to go to university on Monday, but one of my Part C courses is swimming at RTU. To avoid spending all day at work, I sign up for a swim on Mondays. It is imperative to accumulate 20 visits to take this course, so I also go to the pool on some Fridays. The swimming lesson lasts about 1 hour, but does not include showers, changing clothes and time to get to the pool (I use public transport from work). All this takes about 2 and a half hours. The swimming lesson itself is not too difficult - the trainer calculates your strengths and abilities. I also heard that swimming straightens the back, which is very good for students who spend a lot of time sitting at a computer.</p>
        <p>After swimming, I go back to work, completing unresolved tasks that are already much easier to solve - two hours without strong brain activity, relaxing. After work, I go home to rest, eat and prepare for the next day - Tuesday.</p>
